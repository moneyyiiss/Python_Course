#1. Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.
# sol-
# break = 5

# this shows invalid syntax


# 2. Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables

# byear = 2001
# cyear = 2023
# ans = cyear - byear
# print(ans)


# 3. Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables

# first = 'Manish'
# middle = 'Mani'
# last = 'Dinkar'
#
# fullname = first + " " + middle + " " + last
# print(fullname)

# 4. Answer which of these are invalid variable names: _nation 1record record1 record_one record-one record^one continue

# _nation = 1 valid
# 1record = 2 invalid
# record1 = 3 valid
# record_one = 4 valid
# record-one = 5 invalid
# record^one = 6  invalid
# continue = 7  invalid
